A design pattern in C++ is a generic repeatable solution to a frequently occurring problem in software design that is used in software engineering. 
model for problem-solving that may be applied in a variety of contexts.

| Pattern   | Type       | Use Case                                |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Singleton | Creational | Only one global instance                |
| Factory   | Creational | Creating objects based on input         |
| Adapter   | Structural | Interface conversion                    |
| Decorator | Structural | Add behavior at runtime                 |
| Observer  | Behavioral | Notify multiple objects of state change |
| Strategy  | Behavioral | Swap algorithms at runtime              |


(A) Creational pattern:
Deal with the process of object creation, trying to make it more flexible and efficient. 
It makes the system independent and how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

A1 - Factory pattern
provide interface for creating object but leaves init to his derived ones
object creation process is complex or varies under different conditions, using a factory method 
can make your client code simpler and promote reusability

A2 - Singleton pattern
only one instance of a class can exist in the entire program. 
try to create another instance of the class, it will return the same instance that was created earlier.
single database connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate database connection for every object may be costly. 

A3 - Abstract pattern
an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
It’s useful when your application needs to be platform-independent or when working with interchangeable product families

A4 - Builder pattern
used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates object construction from its representation,
allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

A5 - Prototype
used to clone objects, especially when creating new objects is expensive or complex.
Instead of building an object from scratch, you copy an existing one — like making a duplicate key from the original.


| Pattern              | When to Use                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**        | One instance, global access                                           |
| **Factory Method**   | Subclass decides which class to instantiate                           |
| **Abstract Factory** | Create families of related objects                                    |
| **Builder**          | Step-by-step creation of complex objects                              |
| **Prototype**        | Clone existing objects, especially when creation is costly or complex |
