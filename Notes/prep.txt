In C++, typeinfo is part of the Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) system and is defined in the <typeinfo> header. 
It allows you to get information about the type of an object during program execution, which is especially useful 
when working with polymorphism (i.e., base class pointers or references pointing to derived class objects).

ðŸ”§ What typeinfo Does
It provides the typeid operator, which returns a reference to a std::type_info object.

That type_info object contains type-related information such as:

The name of the type (via .name())

Ability to compare types (via ==, !=, etc.)

Great question!

### ðŸ”§ What is **Name Mangling**?

**Name mangling** is a process used by C++ compilers to **encode additional information** (like function arguments, namespaces, class types, etc.) into the names of functions, classes, and variables during compilation.

This is necessary because:

* C++ supports **function overloading**, templates, namespaces, etc.
* The linker (which combines compiled code) needs **unique names** for each symbol (function or variable).
* The C linker doesn't understand C++ features, so the compiler must **"mangle"** names to make them unique.

### ðŸ”“ What is **Demangling**?

**Demangling** is the reverse process: converting the mangled names back into **readable, original C++ names**.

---

### ðŸ§ª Example

Suppose you have this C++ function:

```cpp
void greet(std::string name);
```

The C++ compiler might **mangle** this into something like:

```
_Z5greetNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE
```

That looks unreadable. But if you **demangle** it (using tools like `c++filt`), you get:

```
greet(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)
```

Which is closer to the original declaration.

### ðŸ›  Common Use Cases for Demangling

* **Debugging**: When you get an error or crash with a mangled symbol in a stack trace.
* **RTTI Output**: `typeid(...).name()` often returns a mangled name.
* **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding binary/executable files.

### âœ… How to Demangle (on Linux)

```bash
echo '_Z3addii' | c++filt
```

**Output:**

```
add(int, int)
```

### Summary

| Term          | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mangled**   | Compiler-encoded names for functions/objects. Not human-readable. |
| **Demangled** | Human-readable version of the mangled name.                       |

Let me know if you'd like a C++ code snippet to show the mangling/demangling process!
