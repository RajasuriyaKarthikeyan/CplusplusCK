Class:
    - user defined data type which servers as a blueprint for creating object
    - Define data members and methods that operate on data

Object:
    - instance of class (varibale of class datatype)

construtor : called when object got initialized and helps to initialize date member values
destructor : call when object goes out of scope

Types of construtor:
 default, copy, move, parametrized, delaget, default parametrized

Encapsulation : Binding data and method together to achive certain functionality
Abstraction : Hiding essential details by showing only the abstract layer
Polymorphism : abiliity to exist in more than one form 
    -> Compile Time (function and opertor overaloading)
    -> Run Time (virtual function and pure virtual function)
Inheritance : adaption behaviour and functionality of other classes

virtual function : member function in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class and 
                    is accessed polymorphically via base class pointers or references.

When a class has virtual functions, the compiler:
    Creates a VTable (Virtual Table) for that class.
    Stores a hidden vptr (virtual pointer) inside each object.
    The vptr points to that class's vtable.
    When calling a virtual function through a pointer/reference, the vtable is consulted to find the correct override.

| Term   | Description                                                                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VTable | A static array of function pointers created by the compiler. One per class (not per object). |
| VPtr   | A hidden pointer in each object pointing to the class's vtable.                              |

abstract class : contains only pure virtual function
Interface : contan pure virtual function and virtual destructor

| Feature                         | Abstract Class                    | Interface (C++ style)                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Contains pure virtual functions |   Yes                             |   Yes                                |
| Can have data members           |   Yes                             |   No (ideally)                       |
| Can have implemented methods    |   Yes                             |   No                                 |
| Instantiation                   |   Not allowed                     |   Not allowed                        |
| Inheritance                     | Used for **common base behavior** | Used for **pure contract/interface** |


Templates : in C++ allow generic programming â€” you write code once and use it with different data types.

| Without Template                | With Template              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Code duplication for every type | One function/class for all |
| Type-specific logic only        | Generic, reusable code     |
| Hard to maintain                | Easy to scale & maintain   |

| Feature             | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Function Template   | Write one function for all types     |
| Class Template      | Write one class for all types        |
| Specialization      | Override for specific type behaviors |
| Multiple Parameters | Support more than one generic type   |
